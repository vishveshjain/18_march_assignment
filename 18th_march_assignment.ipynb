    "- Here are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods:\n",
    "    #\n",
    "    - L1 Regularization\n",
    "        - It is also known as Lasso regularization.\n",
    "        - It is a technique that adds a penalty to the loss function of a model for large coefficient values.\n",
    "        - Thie penalty encourages the model to reduce the number of features used by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. As a result, L1 regularization can effectively select a subset of relevant features for the model.\n",
    "        #\n",
    "    - Decision Tree-Based Methods\n",
    "        - Decision tree-based methods, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees, are often used in embedded feature selection. These algorithms use decision trees to identify the most important features for the model, and remove less important features from subsequent trees.\n",
    "        - This process can help to select a subset of relevant features while improving the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "        #\n",
    "    - Gradient Descent-Based Methods\n",
    "        - Gradient descent-based methods, such as Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent, can be used to perform feature selection by adjusting the weights of each feature during training.\n",
    "        - This process can help to identify the most important features for the model, while minimizing the impact of irrelevant features.\n",
    "        #\n",
    "    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "        - PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space. By identifying the principal components of the data, which are the features that explain the most variation in the data, PCA can effectively select a subset of relevant features for the model."

    "    - Lack of Interaction\n",
    "        - The filter method considers the relevance of features individually without considering their interactions. Thus, it may fail to identify important features that have high predictive power only when combined with other features.\n",
    "        #\n",

    "        #\n",
